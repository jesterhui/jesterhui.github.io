Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am currently an applied scientist at AWS working on language models and agents. Prior to AWS, I got my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at the University of Michigan, where my thesis focused on using machine learning to augment and improve quantum mechanical studies of catalytic materials, with a focus on materials discovery and optimization.
