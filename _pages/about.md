Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my professional website. A little about me, I am currently an applied scientist at AWS working on both generative and discriminative natural language models. Prior to Amazon, I got my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at the University of Michigan where my research focused on using machine learning to augment and improve data-driven and computational approaches to studying catalytic materials, which rely heavily on resource-intensive quantum mechanical modeling typically performed on high-performance supercomputers.

I am super passionate about awesome science, technology, and ideas, and find myself lucky to be working in probably the most exciting industry on earth right now. In my free time, you can probably find me trying to catch up on the latest developments in AI, some of which I try to document and share in my blog. Feel free to contact me via email or connect with me via LinkedIn to stay in the loop!
